For this project you are required to build a data analytics application, which allows users to upload private data, view automated analysis of their data and then selectively share the results with other users. You may interpret the concept of "data" and "analysis" very flexibly. For example, the application could be:

An exercise tracking application, where users track their exercise habits, can view stats about their habits, and share information about their achievements with their friends on the system.

A statistical analysis tool, allowing users to upload certain types of datasets (e.g. timeseries, tabular data), and then run standard statistical analysis algorithms (e.g. regression, clustering, outlier detection) on them, and share their findings and datasets with their colleagues.

A course-selector tool, allowing users to upload details (e.g. times, duration, credit hours) of courses they are interested in taking, and then run scheduling algorithms to generate a plausible selection of units, and allowing users to share suggested schedules with their classmates.

A tournament management system, where users can input results of sports/board games tournaments, see player stats, and then share results with other users.
An infectious disease monitoring system where users can upload datasets of infections, and the application will plot them on a map and you can share areas with high outbreaks to other users.

A news sentiment analysis tool, allowing users to upload or input news content, and then analyse the text using NLP algorithms (e.g., sentiment scoring) to determine overall sentiment, and share the analysed data with their colleagues.

Any method of data entry is fine. For example data could be manually entered by the user, or uploaded in batches in a suitable file format, or automatically sourced from other devices and services (e.g. fitness trackers, smart watches, publicly available feeds and datasets).

Please think carefully about the design of the application. It should be:
Engaging, so that it looks good and focuses the user on important elements of the application.
Effective, so it produces value for the user, by providing information, entertainment or community.
Intuitive, so that it is easy for a user to use.

Any concept obeying the guidelines above is fine as long as the website offers the following views:

An "introductory" view, describing the context and purpose of the application, and allowing the user to create an account or log in.
An "upload data" view, allowing the user to add new data.
A "visualise data" view, allowing user's to view analysis of either their data or other people's data which has been shared with them.
A "share data" view, allowing the users to selectively share their data with other specific users.
